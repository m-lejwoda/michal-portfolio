## ðŸ‘¤ About Me
I hold a master's degree in computer science from Maria Curie-SkÅ‚odowska University. Over the past 7 years, I have been developing websites, mostly in my free time, but I also worked professionally as a full stack developer for 2.5 years. During this time, I constantly strived to improve my skills and keep up with the fast-changing world of technology. I am actively learning German to broaden my opportunities and better connect with diverse teams and projects. My passion lies in exploring new technologies and innovative solutions in web development and the IT industry. Django and React are my main technologies, but I am always eager to learn and explore new tools and frameworks that help me enhance my abilities. As a dedicated, persistent, and conscientious person, I approach every project with commitment and a focus on quality. I believe in continuous learning and systematic work, which help me grow both personally and professionally. Currently, I am focusing on developing my skills in DevOps and the Azure cloud platform.
